 * SOLVE marshallian demand : log : should i use cobb-douglas or log form ? 
 * GET_CES_MARSHALLIAN_ALLOCATION() 
    
    ** expansion path
** minimum value of x and y for a given u as we approach leontieff


** add both utilities
    
    
** transformations : standard form to the form ive been working with

<p> linear : price is maximally relevant </p>

<h4> leontieff </h4>
<p> with Leontieff, your preferences are so rigid, that even tho alpha/px &gt; beta/py, the only thing that matters is alpha and beta. price does not factor into the decision. if prices change, you can buy less, but your ratio of x-y does not change. </p>
<p> prices will determine the size of the bundle, but not the ratio of goods x-y </p>
<p> price will not induce you to buy more x at the expense of y, and vise versa. so price is irrelevant </p>
